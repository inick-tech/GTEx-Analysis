## üìù Abstract
This repository contains the official code and analysis pipeline for the paper, "A Generalizable Computational Framework for Deconstructing Tissue-Specific Gene Regulatory Architecture into Orthogonal Components of Module Amplitude and Logic." This research introduces a modular, statistically validated computational framework to analyze co-regulated gene sets (modules) across GTEx tissue transcriptomes. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with rigorous validation (Horn's Parallel Analysis, leave-one-gene-out cross-validation), the framework decomposes variance into two orthogonal axes: **Module Amplitude (PC1)** quantifying overall pathway investment, and **Regulatory Logic (PC2)** capturing functional trade-offs. Demonstrated on circadian clock, interferon-alpha response, and hypoxia pathways, the pipeline uncovers conserved "amplitude-logic" principles, generating hypotheses for tissue-specific regulation.
